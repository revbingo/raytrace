RayTrace
========

This code was originally written by Hj. Malthaner as part of the [Freemapper project](http://sourceforge.net/projects/freemapper/).  

As a learning exercise for myself I have separated, refactored and simplified this code with a view to understanding the core concepts of ray tracing, and aiming for simplicity and readability over performance, accuracy or correctness.
